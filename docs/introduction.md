# Introduction

## What is ENVOYOU?
**ENVOYOU** is an integrated platform designed to address challenges in accessing verified and reliable environmental data. Amidst the growing need for accurate environmental information for decision-making—from ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investments to public policy—ENVOYOU provides a solution for easy and efficient access through modern APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

## Our Vision, Mission, and Goals
### Vision
To become the world's most trusted and accessible source of verified environmental data, empowering decision-making that has a positive impact on planetary sustainability.

### Mission
To integrate environmental data from various global and national sources, perform verification to ensure accuracy, and provide easy and efficient access through modern APIs to support innovators, researchers, and policymakers.

### Goals
- **Comprehensive Data Aggregation:** Continuously collect and unify environmental data from key sources at global and national levels.
- **Superior API Provision:** Develop reliable, fast, and flexible APIs that can overcome technical limitations found on other platforms.
- **Building Trust:** Implement transparent and robust data verification processes to ensure every piece of information presented has the highest credibility.
- **Driving Innovation:** Facilitate the development of applications, research, and new solutions in sustainability by providing solid and easily integrable data foundations.

### Problems We Solve
Currently, environmental data is highly fragmented. Data is scattered across various research institutions, organizations, and government agencies with different formats, structures, and access methods. Users often face challenges such as:
- **Scattered Data:** Difficulty collecting data from various unconnected sources.
- **Technical Limitations:** Many existing APIs have strict limitations, such as limits on the number of data rows per request or complex queries.
- **Limited Access:** Difficulty accessing historical data or performing mass data downloads, especially from national data sources.  
ENVOYOU bridges this gap by acting as an intelligent aggregator that unifies fragmented data into one cohesive and easily accessible platform.

### ENVOYOU's Three Main Pillars
**The core values of the ENVOYOU project are supported by three main pillars:**
- **Credibility:** We prioritize data reliability through rigorous verification processes, so you can trust the information you use.
- **Environmental Relevance:** Our focus is providing comprehensive and relevant environmental data to support sustainability projects, research, and regulatory compliance.
- **Technological Innovation:** By providing reliable modern APIs, we ensure developers and analysts can easily integrate environmental data into their applications and workflows.  
This documentation will guide you to understand how the ENVOYOU API works, access the data you need, and start building more sustainable applications.
