> Transform raw environmental & ESG signals into business, compliance, and investment decisions.

This page outlines flagship user-facing application patterns you can build (or we may offer natively) on top of the Envoyou platform. These patterns accelerate time-to-value by turning **data exhaust** into **operational and strategic intelligence**.

## Overview

| Application Pillar | Primary Users | Core Value | Typical Data Sources |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| Monitoring & Alerts | Sustainability managers, compliance teams | Real-time situational awareness & proactive risk mitigation | Emissions metrics, regulation feeds, facility telemetry |
| Portfolio & Impact Analytics | Investors, strategy, board reporting | Capital allocation insight & ESG risk optimization | Company ESG scores, sector benchmarks, portfolio holdings |
| Reporting & Disclosure Automation | ESG reporting teams, enterprise sustainability leads | Faster GRI / SASB / CSRD aligned output | Normalized KPI store, historical baselines, taxonomy mappings |

---

## 1. ESG Monitoring Dashboard
A central command surface that fuses environmental performance, risk signals, and benchmark context.

Related API Paths: `/benchmarks/industry/{code}`, `/benchmarks/peers`, `/alerts`, `/alerts/{id}` (see OpenAPI spec), plus existing measurement endpoints.

### Key Modules
- **CEVS Score Panel**: Real-time & historical trend (sparkline + delta vs last period). Include percentile vs industry.
- **Benchmark Comparator**: Select peers or auto-suggest top 5 by industry / market cap; visualize radar or stacked variance.
- **Risk & Deviation Feed**: Recent anomalies (e.g., water discharge spike, emissions gap, missing data submission).
- **Alert Center**: Configurable rules & thresholds with delivery channels (email, webhook, Slack, Teams).
- **Regulatory Change Feed**: Parsed + classified regulatory updates mapped to affected facilities or reporting frameworks.

### Suggested UI Layout
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="layout" label="Layout Sketch">
```text
--------------------------------------------------------
|  KPI Header (CEVS Score + Delta + Percentile)        |
--------------------------------------------------------
| Trend & Benchmarks  |  Alerts & Anomalies | Regulations |
| (line + radar)      |  (list + status)    | (feed)      |
--------------------------------------------------------
|   Facility Drilldown (map / table w/ filters)        |
--------------------------------------------------------
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="data" label="Data Contracts">
- `GET /companies/{id}/cevs-score` (current + history window)
- `GET /industries/{code}/benchmark` (percentiles, mean, median)
- `GET /facilities?companyId=...` (geo + operational attributes)
- `GET /alerts` & `POST /alerts` (rule definitions)
- `GET /regulations/updates` (filtered by region / sector)
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Alert Rule Examples
```json title="Water Pollution Threshold"
{
  "metric": "water_discharge_ppm",
  "operator": ">",
  "threshold": 120,
  "window": "1h",
  "notify": ["webhook:ops_env", "email:env_manager@company.com"]
}
```
```json title="CEVS Score Drop"
{
  "metric": "cevs_score",
  "operator": "drop_percent",
  "threshold": 5,
  "window": "24h",
  "notify": ["slack:#esg-risk"]
}
```

### Implementation Notes
- Cache high-frequency metrics (5–15m) with a time-series store (e.g., Timescale / Influx) separate from transactional DB.
- Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for live score deltas; fall back to polling.
- Normalize regulatory feeds via ingestion workers; tag updates with taxonomy facets (framework, jurisdiction, topic).
- Provide role-based scopes: viewer (read metrics), analyst (create alerts), admin (manage peers & facilities).

## 2. Dual-Perspective Analytics (Investor & Company)
One analytics surface serving two distinct personas with filtered lenses.

### Investor Mode
Focus: Portfolio risk-adjusted ESG posture.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Portfolio Aggregation | Weighted composite CEVS & sub-metrics across holdings. |
| Risk Outliers | Highlight bottom decile companies dragging portfolio score or breaching thresholds. |
| Scenario Analysis | Stress test portfolio against regulatory tightening or carbon pricing. |
| Diversification View | Sectoral exposure vs ESG variance matrix. |

### Company Mode
Focus: Operational performance & optimization.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Facility Breakdown | Emissions, water, waste per facility with intensity normalization (per output unit). |
| Cross-Facility Benchmark | Rank facilities; surface top/bottom performers for targeted interventions. |
| Efficiency Opportunities | Algorithmic suggestions (e.g., "Switch Plant 3 coolant tower cycle to reduce water usage 8%" ). |
| Progress Toward Targets | Track science-based targets & forecast trajectories. |

### Shared Engine Components
- Metrics service (aggregation, unit normalization, gap filling).
- Benchmark resolver (industry + peer set logic).
- Scenario engine (parameterized shocks: carbon_price, regulation_delay, intensity_decline_rate).
- Recommendation engine (rule-based + ML ranking of interventions).

### Data API Sketch
```graphql title="Metrics Aggregation"
query PortfolioMetrics($ids: [ID!]!, $window: String!) {
  portfolio(ids: $ids) {
    compositeScore(window: $window) {
      value
      changePct
    }
    metrics(window: $window) {
      key
      value
      change
      confidence
    }
    riskOutliers(limit: 5) { id name score industry }
  }
}

## 3. Sustainability Reporting Integration
Accelerate GRI / SASB / CSRD aligned disclosures.

### Core Capabilities
- **Structured Export**: One-click export: `Export for GRI`, `Export for SASB`, `Export for CSRD` (ZIP containing CSV + JSON + mapping manifest).
- **Taxonomy Mapping Layer**: Internal metric keys ↔ external disclosure codes (versioned; diffable).
- **Change Log**: Track when source metrics or methodologies adjust (audit ready).
- **Webhook Feeds**: Push updated KPI bundles to downstream BI / data warehouse ingestion endpoints.

### Export Package Structure
```text
report_export_<framework>_<YYYYMMDD>/
  manifest.json      # dataset descriptors, version hashes
  metrics.csv        # flattened metric rows
  facilities.csv     # facility dimensional data
  methodology.md     # narrative / assumptions
  mappings.json      # internal key -> framework code
```text

### Example `manifest.json`
```json
{
  "framework": "GRI",
  "version": "2025.2",
  "generatedAt": "2025-09-13T10:15:00Z",
  "recordCounts": {"metrics": 1842, "facilities": 27},
  "source": "envoyou-platform",
  "hash": "b1f7c0c2..."
}
```

### Webhook Delivery Contract
```http
POST /webhooks/report-update HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Signature: t=1694592100,v1=3c5bd...
{
  "framework": "SASB",
  "bundleId": "sasb_2025_q3_rev1",
  "url": "https://exports.envoyou.com/bundles/sasb_2025_q3_rev1.zip",
  "delta": true,
  "changedSections": ["water_management", "emissions_scope2"],
  "generatedAt": "2025-09-13T10:20:11Z"
}
```

### Security & Governance
- Sign all webhook payloads (HMAC SHA-256 w/ secret per destination).
- Allow replay protection via timestamp + nonce.
- Maintain version graph of taxonomy mappings; expose diff endpoint.

## Architecture Layering
```text
[ Ingestion ] -> [ Normalization ] -> [ Metrics Store ] -> [ Application Services ] -> [ UI / Exports / Webhooks ]
                           ^                ^
                           |                |
                     Benchmark Engine   Taxonomy Mapper
```

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Idempotent ingestion & late-arriving data reconciliation.
- Time-zone & unit normalization early in pipeline.
- Observability: tracing around alert evaluation & export generation.
- Access control: attribute-based (role + company + facility scope).

---

## Build Roadmap (Indicative)
| Phase | Scope | Outcomes |
| ----- | ----- | -------- |
| 0 | Foundations | Metric catalog, baseline CEVS scoring, ingestion MVP |
| 1 | Monitoring | Dashboard widgets, alert rules engine, benchmarks |
| 2 | Dual Analytics | Investor + company lenses, scenario engine |
| 3 | Reporting | Export generator, taxonomy mapper, webhooks |
| 4 | Optimization | Intervention recommender, ML ranking, advanced forecasting |

## Next Steps
- Prioritize Phase 1 vs Phase 2 depending on go-to-market focus.
- Define core metric ontology & naming conventions (feeds everything).
- Begin alert rules engine schema & persistence design.
- Draft taxonomy mapping JSON structure & versioning strategy.
